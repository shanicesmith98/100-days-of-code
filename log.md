# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 1, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Began Object Oriented coding in Java on Codecademy and went through problems on Leetcode

**Thoughts**: To be honest, this lesson scared me at first. It was hard to jump in, but once I went through the first section, I was immediately inspired to build my own objects and constructors. Would like to do more Leetcode in the future, but might need more fundamental knowledge before diving back in.

### Day 2: April 2, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Object Oriented section in Java on Codecademy after reviewing Array basics on Youtube

**Thoughts**: Still uncertain of using toString method and how it applies to real-world projects, but will play around with.

### Day 3: April 3, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Began JavaScript on freeCodeCamp, completed If-Then Statements and Conditionals through

**Thoughts**: Feeling much more confident with if-then statements and conditionals. Wish I had ideas to build simple programs around them to practice the skills today.
