# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 1, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Began Object Oriented coding in Java on Codecademy and went through problems on Leetcode
**Thoughts** To be honest, this lesson scared me at first. It was hard to jump in, but once I went through the first section, I was immediately inspired to build my own objects and constructors. Would like to do more Leetcode in the future, but might need more fundamental knowledge before diving back in.
